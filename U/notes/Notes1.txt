JS library for building UI. 
ReactDom.render method allows us to render a js function as a component to the real DOM . 

why use react ? because UI state becomes difficult to handle with vanilla js. (So we can focus on business logic)

routing - Single page aplicationgs : rhandle different URLs and render different pages , even if we only have one html page . by parsing the url with js and re render part of the DOM that need to be re-rendered to display the new page

redux - Third party library . 


js basics : 

let = variable values, const = constant values

Classes = made from properties + methods properties = variables , methods = functions 


state = State can be changed and if it changes
and that's the special thing about it and it only works on that state property, if it changes, it will
lead React to re-render our DOM or to update the DOM I should say.
So if we change the name of Max here for example, this will lead to this being re-rendered.

Update Dom = state or props 

using hooks to manage state , got to manually makes sure to include all old state data 


use inline style when we want to scope to a style to a single element
